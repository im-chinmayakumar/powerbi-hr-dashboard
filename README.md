# Learning by Doing!

I recently worked on this **HR Dashboard** using **Power BI**, and it was a great hands‑on experience in data visualization and storytelling.  
From analyzing headcount by job role, gender, and age to visualizing salary trends and join‑date patterns — every chart added a layer of insight.

**Key things I practiced:**
- Bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots  
- Cumulative headcount trend  
- Age and gender distribution  
- Combining visuals to create an impactful story

Still learning, still improving — and always open to feedback and suggestions!

**I’m currently looking for Data Analyst / Business Analyst opportunities.**  
If you come across any openings or can refer me, I’d be really grateful! 🙏
