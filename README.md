📊 HR Dashboard in Power BI – Real-World Analytics in Action
I recently built an interactive HR Dashboard using Power BI, and it was an exciting hands-on journey into the world of data storytelling and workforce analytics.

From uncovering insights about headcount by job role, gender, and age to identifying salary trends and employee onboarding patterns, each visual was thoughtfully designed to turn raw HR data into actionable insights.

✅ Key Skills & Features Practiced:
📌 Designed impactful bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots

📈 Visualized cumulative headcount trends over time

👥 Explored age and gender distribution across departments

🧠 Blended multiple visuals into a story-driven dashboard

🛠️ Strengthened skills in Power BI, DAX, data modeling, and clean visualization layouts

🎯 Why this project matters:
It mirrors real-world HR use cases—helping HR teams make data-driven decisions about hiring, diversity, compensation, and workforce planning.

🚀 I’m currently open to Data Analyst / Business Analyst opportunities
If you're hiring or can refer me, I’d be truly grateful for the support! 🙏
Let’s connect and grow together.
